# Trade Schema Data Plan

## Implementation Status (2026-07-07)

There is no dedicated `trade` schema — trade data lives in `census` and `econ`.

- **`bea_fdi_by_industry` — DELIVERED** as `econ.fdi_direct_investment` +
  `econ.fdi_activities` (BEA `MNE` dataset, Country × Industry, inward/outward), surfaced
  by the `econ.fdi_by_country` view. Shape is tall (vs. this plan's wide) and it lives in
  `econ`, not a `trade` schema. Only the plan's secondary `IIP` dataset is unwired.
- **`usa_trade_monthly` — DELIVERED** (substance) as `econ.trade_exports` /
  `econ.trade_imports`. Originally a thin country-level annual aggregate with a **hardcoded
  3-year `time` list** (frozen at 2023) living in the `census` schema. Reworked 2026-07-07 to
  the `intltrade/{exports,imports}/hs` endpoints: HS-6 × country × **month**, with value,
  quantity, and (imports) CIF charges; dynamic `year` yearRange (never hardcoded) ×
  `month` list, partitioned `[type, direction, year, month]` with `overwritePartitions`. The
  `/hs` series requires discrete `YEAR=`/`MONTH=` predicates (a `time=YYYY-MM` predicate
  returns HTTP 204). **Moved from `census` to `econ` (2026-07-08)** to consolidate with the
  BEA trade/FDI tables — all trade data now lives in one schema. Verification gate: a keyed
  ETL/DQ run (`CENSUS_API_KEY`) — not yet completed.
- **`usa_trade_by_state` — NOT IMPLEMENTED.** State exports (`intltrade/exports/statehs`)
  remain to be built.

## Existing Coverage in ECON Schema

The `econ` schema already includes the following trade-related tables:

| Table | Content |
|---|---|
| `ita_data` | BEA International Transactions Accounts — balance of payments (quarterly/annual) |
| `trade_statistics` | View over BEA NIPA 4.2.5B — exports/imports of goods and services |
| `trade_balance_summary` | Aggregated view: total exports, imports, net balance by category |

These cover **macro-level BEA balance-of-payments data**. The gaps this plan addresses:

1. **HS-commodity granularity** — `usa_trade_monthly` adds Census HS-6 × country × month (not in econ)
2. **State-level exports** — `usa_trade_by_state` adds sub-national export exposure (not in econ)
3. **FDI by industry** — `bea_fdi_by_industry` adds multinational enterprise investment flows (different BEA dataset from ITA)

The `bea_international_transactions` table proposed below overlaps with `econ.ita_data`
and should **not** be implemented if the econ ITA coverage is sufficient. Evaluate after
comparing column sets.

## Strategic Context (Extensions)

This plan extends the existing macro trade coverage in `econ` with commodity-level and
sub-national detail. The primary additional cross-schema value is **supply chain and
company-level trade analysis**: HS-6 import flows by country join to SEC 10-K filings
for companies disclosing material import/export exposure; state exports join to BLS
employment for trade-affected community research.

### `usa_trade_by_state`

Annual U.S. merchandise exports by state of origin and destination country. Provides
sub-national export exposure; joins to `econ.bls_employment` for trade-affected
manufacturing communities; joins to `fec.contributions` for trade-sensitive donor geography.

**Source:** Census Bureau USA Trade — State Exports by HS Commodity
**Partition:** `export_year`

## Join Architecture

```
[macro-level — use econ.ita_data / econ.trade_statistics for balance-of-payments]

    └── usa_trade_monthly (flow + year/month → granular HS-level commodity detail)
            └── sec.filing_metadata (HS chapter → NAICS → company import/export exposure)

geo.states (state_fips)
    └── usa_trade_by_state (state_fips, export_year)
            ├── econ.bls_employment (state_fips → manufacturing employment)
            └── fec.contributions (state_fips → trade-sensitive donor geography)

ref.lei_entities (lei)
    └── bea_fdi_by_industry (industry + country → cross-border M&A context)
```

## Implementation Notes

- **HS code vintage.** The Harmonized System is revised every 5 years (HS-2002, HS-2007,
  HS-2012, HS-2017, HS-2022). Census trade data uses the current HS vintage for each year.
  Long time series across revisions require HS concordance tables (UN Statistics Division
  publishes these). Store `hs_revision_year` for future concordance mapping.
- **Monthly trade volume.** At HS-6 × country × month, the dataset is ~2M rows/year.
  Filter to `hs2 IN (select industries of interest)` for targeted analysis; store full
  detail for initial load.
- **BEA API rate limits.** BEA enforces 100 requests/minute with an API key. The initial
  load for ITA quarterly data going back to 1960 requires ~200 API calls; implement
  exponential backoff.
