# ECON Schema Documentation

## Overview

The ECON schema provides unified access to economic indicators from multiple U.S. government sources including the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Treasury Direct, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and World Bank.

The schema includes comprehensive regional economic data covering 1,845 BLS data series across state, metro, and Census region geographic levels:
- Regional CPI (4 regions), Metro CPI (27 metros)
- State Industry Employment (1,122 series), State Wages (51 series)
- Metro Industry Employment (594 series), Metro Wages (27 series)
- JOLTS Regional (20 series)

## Architecture Note: FileSchema Delegation

The ECON schema operates as a **declarative data pipeline** that:
1. **Downloads** economic data from multiple government APIs
2. **Transforms** time series data to optimized Parquet format
3. **Enriches** tables with metadata, comments, and foreign key constraints
4. **Delegates** actual query execution to the FileSchema adapter

This means you get the benefits of:
- **Unified access** - Multiple APIs through single SQL interface
- **Automatic updates** - Data refreshed based on configuration
- **API key management** - Handles authentication transparently
- **Cross-domain joins** - Foreign keys link to GEO schema for regional analysis

## API Configuration

### Required API Keys
```bash
export BLS_API_KEY=your_bls_api_key      # Bureau of Labor Statistics
export FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_api_key    # Federal Reserve Economic Data
export BEA_API_KEY=your_bea_api_key      # Bureau of Economic Analysis
```

### Model Configuration
```json
{
  "name": "econ",
  "type": "custom",
  "factory": "org.apache.calcite.adapter.govdata.GovDataSchemaFactory",
  "operand": {
    "dataSource": "econ",
    "blsApiKey": "${BLS_API_KEY}",
    "fredApiKey": "${FRED_API_KEY}",
    "beaApiKey": "${BEA_API_KEY}",
    "enabledSources": ["bls", "fred", "treasury", "bea"],
    "updateFrequency": "daily",
    "cacheExpiry": "24h"
  }
}
```

### BLS Table Filtering

Control which BLS tables are downloaded and visible in the schema using `blsConfig`:

#### Include Tables (Whitelist)
```json
{
  "operand": {
    "blsConfig": {
      "includeTables": ["regional_cpi", "metro_cpi", "state_wages"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Exclude Tables (Blacklist)
```json
{
  "operand": {
    "blsConfig": {
      "excludeTables": ["state_industry", "metro_industry"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Notes**:
- Cannot specify both `includeTables` and `excludeTables` (mutually exclusive)
- Omitting `blsConfig` downloads all tables (backward compatible)
- Excluded tables will not appear in the SQL schema
- Useful for managing BLS API quotas (500 daily requests without key, 500/day with key)

**Available BLS Tables**:
- `employment_statistics` (~3 series)
- `inflation_metrics` (~3 series)
- `regional_cpi` (4 series)
- `metro_cpi` (27 series)
- `state_industry` (1,122 series) ⚠️ API intensive
- `state_wages` (51 series)
- `metro_industry` (594 series) ⚠️ API intensive
- `metro_wages` (27 series)
- `jolts_regional` (20 series)
- `wage_growth` (~2 series)
- `regional_employment` (~3 series)

**Example: Minimize API Calls**
```json
{
  "blsConfig": {
    "excludeTables": ["state_industry", "metro_industry"]
  }
}
```
This excludes 1,716 series (saves ~35 API calls per year) while retaining all other regional data.

## Performance Tips

1. **Use Date Filters**: Always filter by date range to reduce data scanned
2. **Leverage Partitioning**: Data is partitioned by year for efficient queries
3. **Cache Frequent Queries**: Economic data changes slowly, cache results
4. **Join on Indexed Columns**: Use series_id and date columns for joins
5. **Aggregate Wisely**: Pre-aggregate in subqueries before joining
